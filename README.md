Twitch User Statistics
======================

Twitch user statistics is a Ruby on Rails application for following twitch user subscription development.


### Introduction

Twitch.tv is the most popular video game live streaming platform available. 
Since it's launch on June 2011, Twitch.tv has been acquired by Amazon for nearly $1 billion and has 
created a large fanbase around the world. Twitch.tv video content is being generated by it's users, which some 
of have become very popular. For these popular Twitch.tv streamers, twitch offers a partnership program which adds a 
subscription button to the users stream page. These subscriptions cost 4.99$ a month and can be cancelled at anytime. 
50% of the cost of Twitch.tv subscription is given to the streamer while the rest is kept by Twitch.

Due to the high popularity of this fairly new form of user generated content, some streamers are getting so many subscriptions 
per month that they can do video game live streaming for living. Any information about user subscription counts however are not 
publicly available.

The reason for the creation of this application is to gather and display statistics and information regarding the 
subscription counts for a select number of Twitch.tv partners in order to get a better understanding of this new form employment.

### Technology

Twitch User Statistics is a Ruby on Rails web application built using Firebase backend and various front-end libraries such as Bootstrap and Chart.js.
In addition to the web application itself, there is a node.js worker application which is handling all the raw data mining operations from Twitch.tv and 
storing the gathered information into a shared Firebase backend.
The accuracy of the data mining process is subject to the stability of various Twitch.tv services and is therefore not 100% accurate.
